# About the script

This is a GUI SMS sending app made by shadyabhi (abhijeet.1989@hmail.com)

Right now, it supports only mycantos but in future releases, it will support many other providers.

# About the config file

You need to have a config file (name as .creds) which will contain your passwords.

Sample config file (Note the empty line at the end)

    [mycantos]
    username = shadyabhi
    password = mypassword
    
You can add multiple services to the config file by running the set_creds.py file.
